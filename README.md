# WebsiteSwitchButtonProject
Arduino project; button toggle webpage testing with an esp32s2 link and breadboard functions


 This project generates a local hosted website using the wifi connection; using both html and javascript, creates an interactive slider switch button toggle
 Button display can be turned off and on with both the mouse and the button switch on the physical breadboard.
 Led was used (seen through the led pin input) to indicate a functioning connectivity to the breadboard and to represent the on/off condition of the website slider button toggle.
